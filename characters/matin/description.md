# Character: Matin

---

## 🧍 Body & Shape
- Build: Lean, slightly fragile, not muscular. More like someone who walks and observes than trains.  
- Posture: Shoulders a bit rounded, gaze often downward or sideways → scanning details (leaves, stones, sounds).  
- Movement: Slow, mindful, with pauses. Steps are careful; body “listens” more than “projects.”

## 🙂 Face
- Shape: Soft oval, not sharply angular.  
- Skin: Pale/neutral, with traces of time outdoors (slight redness on nose/cheeks).  
- Expression: Thoughtful, distant, sometimes dreamy. Micro-smiles when something subtle catches attention.  
- Eyes: Dark, observant, a bit watery or tired — not piercing, but absorbing.  
- Eyebrows: Natural, slightly messy (not perfectly groomed).  
- Mouth: Lips often pressed gently, as if holding unspoken words.

## 💇 Hairstyle
- Medium length, unstyled, falling naturally (slight waves or straight).  
- Looks like it hasn’t seen hair gel or strict styling in years.  
- Sometimes tucked behind ears while writing or walking.  
- Colors: natural shades (brown, dark blond, or black). No dye.  

---

## 👕 Clothing
- Prefers layers: loose shirts, cardigans, soft fabrics.  
- Colors: earthy (moss green, beige, brown, muted grey, washed blue). No shiny or synthetic.  
- Shoes: simple walking shoes, slightly worn. Sometimes sandals in summer.  
- Fabrics: linen, cotton, wool — textures that “breathe” and feel alive.  
- Style: unbranded, timeless, practical. Clothes carry memories, not trends.

## 🎒 Accessories & What They Carry
- Bag: Small canvas or leather satchel (not a backpack). Always slightly heavy with notebooks and small objects found on walks.  
- Notebook(s): One for structured memory-writing, one for leaf/ritual notes.  
- Audio Recorder / Phone App: Used to capture sounds (rain, footsteps, street noise).  
- Pockets: Occasionally a pressed leaf, a pebble, or ticket stubs from a bus/train.  
- Pen: Always carried, sometimes more than one, with ink stains on fingers.  
- Headphones: Old, wired ones — not sleek AirPods.  
- Scarf: In cooler weather, a soft scarf, often neutral or handwoven.

## 🌿 Overall Look
- Aura: Quiet, almost invisible in a crowd — yet deeply present when noticed.  
- Nothing screams fashion; instead, everything whispers ritual, memory, nature.  
- Looks like someone who could disappear into a library corner or under a tree for hours.
