Matin was restless and irritated, the kind of prickly mood that sticks to you like static. Nothing exactly terrible had happened—just a messy morning that wouldn’t line up. His shoelace snapped when he tugged it tight. Breakfast tasted like cardboard. Every sound seemed too loud. He swung his satchel over his shoulder, shoved his hands in his pockets, and stepped outside.

The street punched him with noise. Cars coughed. A motorbike rattled past with a growl. Someone’s phone sang three different ringtones before it was finally answered.Matin flinched. Crowds swelled along the sidewalk, everyone moving fast in angles that made no sense. He knew most people could carry on fine inside all that clatter, like fish in a river. But for him the current always felt a bit too strong. He hated that about himself sometimes, but it was true.

So he escaped, as he always did, to the park.

The park sat like a pocket of calm sewn onto the side of the city. The path opened between old trees whose branches tangled together like friendly fingers. Matin loosened his shoulders. He had a habit here: he scanned. He didn’t even mean to. His eyes just collected things—tiny things other people stepped past.
- An ant carrying a breadcrumb bigger than its head.
- A patch of moss shaped exactly like a comma.
- A poster peeling from a lamppost, the corner slowly uncurling and recurling as the wind teased it.
He took small joy in these details, and the joy, small as it was, started to sand down the edges of his irritation.

On the grassy field, a group of teenagers kicked a football back and forth. Their voices carried across the open space, bright and easy. One of them waved. “Hey! You want in?” Matin hesitated. He wasn’t much of a sports person, not really, but the idea of being included tugged at him.

“Sure,” he said, trying to sound casual. He shuffled onto the field, the ground springy under his heels.

The ball zipped over. Matin pictured what he was supposed to do: step forward, swing, connect. Simple. He stepped, he swung—then something went wrong in the air. The ball thunked him on the side of the head with a hollow sound, the kind that makes your ears ring. The sky tilted for a second. Everyone laughed—not meanly, just surprised—but laughter is prickly when your head is smarting.
Matin managed a thumbs-up and a wobbly grin, then muttered, “I’m good,” and drifted off the field before the heat in his cheeks could set his whole head on fire.
He felt ridiculous, like a badly folded paper airplane that couldn’t keep its line.

He walked the path again, dizzy fading, frustration swelling back. Why had he even tried to play? He should have known. He kicked at a pebble. It skittered, then caught in a crack. Typical.

That was when the leaf fell.

It came from the high branches of a sycamore, let go by a breeze that wasn’t even trying. The leaf glided in a lazy, looping descent, a quiet yellow against the patchwork of sky. Matin stopped walking. Everything else—the distant voices, the traffic, the part of his brain that was still busy being embarrassed—blurred and softened. The leaf spun once like a coin, drifted sideways, and drifted back. Its edges were scalloped and slightly torn, the veins running through it like roads on a map.

The leaf touched down—of all places—right across his forehead and nose. It stayed there for half a second, soft and ticklish, as if the tree had booped him hello. Matin snorted a laugh he didn’t expect. The leaf slid to the toe of his shoe. He bent, picked it up gently by the stem, and felt a calm idea settle in his mind. Not a loud idea. A quiet click.

He carried the leaf home in his satchel, taking care not to crush it between his notebooks and the pencil case with the broken zipper. His room was small but neat, the kind of neatness that makes space for thinking.
On his desk waited his notebook—the thick, dog-eared one he always carried. It wasn’t for homework. It was for keeping tiny things:
- the sorts of objects that couldn’t possibly matter and yet somehow did.
- A ticket stub from when a new train line opened and he rode to the end just to see the last station.
- A smooth pebble the size of a grape he found the day he discovered a shortcut to the library.
- A red thread from the tail of a kite that got away.
Each thing had a date and a small scribble beside it—a sentence, a sketch, a memory in shorthand.

He opened the notebook to a blank page near the back and set the leaf down in the center. He folded the page over it carefully, then sandwiched the notebook under his heaviest book—an old dictionary that could flatten almost anything.
While he waited, he reached for a pencil and wrote the date at the top. Under that: “Sycamore leaf, yellow, soft. Landed on my nose. Felt like the world tapped me on the shoulder and said, ‘Hey. Look.’”

The bad moment from the football field hadn’t disappeared. His head still had a tender spot. He could still hear the sudden pop of laughter. But now something else sat beside it, like a second picture placed on top of the first. When he replayed the afternoon in his mind, the embarrassing knock didn’t end the story. It was followed by a leaf floating down, insisting on being noticed, then a laugh that was actually his own. The edge of the memory softened.

He slid the notebook out from under the dictionary and pressed the page flat again. The leaf looked even more delicate now, every vein clear, the color warm as toast.

Matin leaned back. He thought about how days stack up the way pages do. You can’t tear out the ones you don’t like without ripping the binding. But you can add another page. You can glue in a leaf. You can choose what you carry.
