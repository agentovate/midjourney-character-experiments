# Scene 002 — From Street to Park

Matin was restless and irritated.  
He swung his satchel over his shoulder and stepped outside, only to find the streets crowded and noisy — something he could never stand.  
So he escaped into the park, scanning the world around him as always, taking small joy in details others ignored.  

A group of teenagers played football nearby. He tried joining in, but the ball struck his head instead of his foot. Dizzy and frustrated, he walked away.  

On the sidewalk, a leaf drifted down.  
Matin watched its delicate line of descent until it landed gently against his forehead and nose. He picked it up, suddenly struck by a thought that replaced irritation with excitement.  

Back home, he pressed the leaf into his notebook — the same one he always carried to collect small objects.  
That day, he realized: a bad memory could be replaced by a good one, carried forward in silence.
