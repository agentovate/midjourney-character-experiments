# midjourney-character-experiments

This repository documents my experiments with **AI-generated character design** using MidJourney.  
The goal is to explore how generative AI can help maintain **consistency of a character across multiple scenes in a story**.

## ðŸŒ¿ Character: Matin
Matin is a reflective, memory-driven persona.  
The design covers body shape, clothing, facial details, and emotional aura.

## ðŸ“Œ Why on GitHub?
- To keep track of iterative versions of character design.  
- To share **prompt-engineering experiments** with the AI community.  
- To show practical applications of **generative AI in creative workflows**.
