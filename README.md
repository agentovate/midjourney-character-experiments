# midjourney-character-experiments

This repository documents my experiments with **AI-generated character design** using MidJourney.  
The goal is to explore how generative AI can help maintain **consistency of a character across multiple scenes in a story**.

## ðŸŒ¿ Character: Matin
Matin is a reflective, memory-driven persona.  
The design covers body shape, clothing, facial details, and emotional aura.

ðŸ“„ [Matinâ€™s Character Sheet (Markdown)](characters/matin/description.md)
This incloudes generated images(characters/matin/Matin Images)

## ðŸ“– Story
A character is not only defined by physical description, but also by **how they move through situations**.  
By placing Matin inside short scenes, I can test whether generative AI keeps his personality, mood, and aura consistent across different contexts.
It turns raw AI generations into a reproducible design process, where the goal is not just a picture, but a living, evolving persona.

## ðŸŽ¨ Prompts
This repo also includes the prompts I used to generate consistent outputs in MidJourney:  
- [Matin prompts](characters/matin/matin_prompts.txt)

## ðŸ“Œ Why on GitHub?
- To keep track of iterative versions of character design.  
- To share **prompt-engineering experiments** with the AI community.  
- To show practical applications of **generative AI in creative workflows**.
